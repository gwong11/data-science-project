20181221,26044860,Completing the NITRC triad of services is the NITRC Computational Environment (NITRC-CE).,nitrc

20181221,26044860,"The FRS mode of data sharing through NITRC-R is relatively easy for the data provider, it places more of the data decoding burden the end user, particularly when the data for a project is released in multiple archive files each containing many subjects.",nitrc
20181221,26044860,"Second, the NITRC-IR was designed as a fully curated federated XNAT neuroimaging database that could host data for NITRC projects in a searchable framework.",nitrc
20181221,26044860,We customized an XNAT instance to seamlessly interoperate with the NITRC-R environment.,nitrc
20181221,26044860,This included establishing a common user-base mapping between the NITRC and XNAT applications as we desired a ‘single sign-on’ and needed to manage project-level permissions via the NITRC-R users and projects.,nitrc
20181221,26044860,Each NITRC-R project can have an associated NITRC-IR (XNAT) project.,nitrc
20181221,26044860,The permissions for access to the XNAT project can be set to mirror the accessibility options of the NITRC-R project.,nitrc
